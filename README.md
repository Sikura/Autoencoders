## Autoencoders - Movielens

In this project, we try to build a movie recommendation system (binary) on movielens dataset using autoencoders. This project was done as a part of Deep Learning A-Z course on Udemy. In this project, I also explored using pytorch for developing the models.

The Jupyter notebook with autoencoder model can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Autoencoders/blob/master/autoencoder.ipynb).
